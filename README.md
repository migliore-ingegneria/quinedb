# QuineDB

**QuineDB** is a high-performance, distributed, in-memory key-value store built with modern C++ (C++20). It is designed to demonstrate advanced systems programming concepts, including thread-per-core architecture, asynchronous I/O with `io_uring`, and shared-nothing sharding.

## Features
*   **High Performance Architecture**:
    *   **Thread-per-core**: Each core manages its own shard of data, eliminating lock contention on the data path.
    *   **Shared-Nothing**: No shared memory between cores; strict partitioning.
    *   **Asynchronous I/O**: Built on `io_uring` (Linux) for high-throughput non-blocking I/O (with fallback to `kqueue` mock for macOS/BSD development).

*   **Redis-Compatible Protocol (RESP)**:
    *   Connect using any standard Redis client (e.g., `redis-cli`, `redis-py`).

*   **Rich Data Structures**:
    *   **Strings**: `SET`, `GET`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `DEL`
    *   **Lists**: `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `LPOP`, `RPOP`, `LRANGE`, `LLEN`
    *   **Sets**: `SADD`, `SREM`, `SMEMBERS`, `SISMEMBER`, `SCARD`
    *   **Hashes**: `HSET`, `HGET`, `HGETALL`, `HDEL`, `HLEN`
    *   **Sorted Sets**: `ZADD`, `ZREM`, `ZSCORE`, `ZCARD`, `ZRANGE` (with `WITHSCORES`)

*   **Advanced Features**:
    *   **Persistence**: RDB-compatible snapshotting (save/load) to disk.
    *   **TTL**: Key expiration (`EXPIRE`, `TTL`) with lazy expiration.
    *   **Scalability**: Consistent Hashing with connection forwarding for seamless horizontal scaling.

## Building QuineDB

### Prerequisites
*   C++20 compliant compiler (GCC 11+, Clang 13+)
*   CMake 3.20+
*   Linux (recommended for `io_uring`) or macOS.

### Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running the Server

Start the server using the compiled binary. By default, it runs on port `6379`.

```bash
./build/bin/quine-server
```

You should see startup logs indicating the server has initialized on available cores.

## Usage

Connect using `redis-cli` or any compatible client:

```bash
redis-cli -p 6379
```

### Examples

**Strings & TTL**
```redis
SET mykey "Hello QuineDB"
EXPIRE mykey 10
GET mykey
TTL mykey
```

**Sorted Sets**
```redis
ZADD leaderboard 100 "PlayerA"
ZADD leaderboard 200 "PlayerB"
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1 WITHSCORES
```

**Persistence**
```redis
SAVE
# Data saved to data/dump.rdb
```

## Testing & Benchmarks

QuineDB comes with a comprehensive suite of unit tests and benchmarks.

**Running Unit Tests** (requires GoogleTest)
```bash
# Build tests
cmake --build build --target unit_tests
# Run
./build/bin/unit_tests
```

**Running Benchmarks** (requires Google Benchmark)
```bash
# Build benchmarks
cmake --build build --target benchmarks
# Run
./build/bin/benchmarks
```

## Deployment

### Docker
QuineDB is available as a Docker image.

**Pull from GitHub Container Registry:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ichbingautam/quinedb:latest
docker run -p 6379:6379 ghcr.io/ichbingautam/quinedb:latest
```

### Kubernetes
Exaple manifests are available in `k8s/`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/statefulset.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

### Render
QuineDB is configured for deployment on [Render](https://render.com).
Simply connect this repository to Render and use the provided `blueprint`.
The `render.yaml` configuration sets up a **Private TCP Service** with persistent disk storage.

## Architecture

### Thread-per-Core
QuineDB spawns one worker thread per available CPU core. Keys are mapped to specific shards using **Consistent Hashing** (Ring architecture with virtual nodes).

### Request Routing
When a client connects to any core, QuineDB's internal Router determines which shard owns the requested key.
*   If the key belongs to the current core, it is processed immediately.
*   If it belongs to another core, the request is forwarded internally via lock-free message passing channels.

### Persistence
The `RdbManager` handles snapshotting the in-memory state to disk in a format compatible with Redis RDB (v1), ensuring data durability across restarts.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for a robust CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml`):
*   **Linting**: Enforced via `clang-format`.
*   **Safety**: Runs AddressSanitizer (ASan), ThreadSanitizer (TSan), and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan).
*   **Release**: Automated Docker builds and GHCR publishing on release tags (`v*`).

## Roadmap

*   **Consensus**: Full Raft implementation for distributed fault tolerance (Skeleton currently in `src/consensus`).
*   **Active Expiration**: Background eviction of expired keys.
*   **Cluster Mode**: Multi-node clustering support.
